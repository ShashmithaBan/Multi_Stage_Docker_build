ðŸš€ Golang Calculator with Multi-Stage Docker Build

This repository demonstrates how to use multi-stage Docker builds to create a lean, production-ready Docker image for a simple Golang calculator application. It also highlights the benefits of using distroless images and explains why Ubuntu is used in the build stage.

ðŸ“¦ Whatâ€™s Inside?

This project includes:
	â€¢	A standard Dockerfile for building a Go app.
	â€¢	A multi-stage Dockerfile for building and deploying a minimal, secure, and efficient container.
	â€¢	Explanations of multi-stage builds, image optimizations, distroless containers, and runtime vs. build stages.

ðŸ§± What is a Multi-Stage Build?

A multi-stage build allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile to separate build-time and runtime environments.

Instead of shipping build tools and compilers in the final image, we build the application in one stage and copy only the necessary output (like a binary) into a minimal base image (e.g., scratch).

âœ… Benefits of Multi-Stage Builds
	â€¢	Smaller Image Sizes â€“ Only includes runtime essentials.
	â€¢	Better Security â€“ Fewer packages = smaller attack surface.
	â€¢	Optimized Builds â€“ Stages can be tailored for specific tasks.
	â€¢	Efficient Caching â€“ Speeds up rebuilds when changes are minimal.
